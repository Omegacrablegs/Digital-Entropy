# Digital-Entropy
Main game engine for Digital-Entropy card game being developed as a group project for Android Dev. 
Based on the card game Love Letter.

As it currently stands the game is functional and will play in a terminal window.

Current To-Do List:
1) Add Handmaiden functionality
2) Fix baron card update bug (Baron tests against that player using it's own value if played from the card 1 slot)
3) Fix King card update bug (King trades itself against that player if played from the card 1 slot)
4) Add AI's to play against the player
5) replace typed options with java buttons
6) Code Refactoring (Large multi-step process, will be broken down into parts once it is approached)
