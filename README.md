# Digital-Entropy
Main game engine for Digital Entropy card game being developed as a group project for Android Dev. 
Based on the card game Love Letter.

The game will function similarly to love letter but will have some new card types and other features made possible by the
digital format. The theme will also be changed to more of a Cyber-Punk style.

As it currently stands the game is functional and based on the current version of Love Letter. Plays in a terminal window just as a player. No information is hidden yet to allow for easy bug fixes and game changes

Current To-Do List:
1) Add Handmaiden functionality
2) Fix baron card update bug (Baron tests against that player using it's own value if played from the card 1 slot)
3) Fix King card update bug (King trades itself against that player if played from the card 1 slot)
4) Add AI's to play against the player
5) replace typed options with java buttons
6) Remove all Print statements and allow the game to run with hidden knowledge
7) Code Refactoring (Large multi-step process, will be broken down into parts once it is approached)
8) Change game Theme
9) Explore new card types
10) Explore new game mechanics
